- A repo for storing the semester's worth of work on Quantum Random Walk with Resetting procedures under prof Tanay Nag
## Abstract of our report 
This project investigates the behaviour of quantum random walkers (QRWs) under resetting mechanisms. Using a model governed by space and spin degrees of freedom via unitary transformations, we analyse QRWs in one- and two-dimensional systems and compare their dynamics to classical random walks to evaluate improvements in search efficiency. Additionally, the study focuses on one-dimensional QRWs with Initial Position Resetting strategies, demonstrating their potential to enhance detection probabilities and reduce search times significantly.
